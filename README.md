# Introduction to Spatial analysis 

This is the notebook of the introductory session on Spatial transcriptomics during the Festival of Genomics 2025 (London).

The spatial data in this tutorial is a toy dataset that was subsampled from a real pancreatic cancer dataset provided by Adam Bryce (University of Glasgow). It is a multiplex (mIF) experiment using several markers to detect important cell types. 

This tutorial is intended to be an introduction to spatial analysis. Additional analytical steps will depend on the technology used, the tissue and the biological question you are addressing.
